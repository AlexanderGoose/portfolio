# Alexander Gustafson Portfolio Site

Welcome to the repo for my portfolio website. 

This site combines many features of coding that I have come to love. Front-end development that obsesses over niche css features, backend development using simple frameworks, and basic api calls.

The entire repo was re-set due to the local repo being stored on the cloud. Sadly most of the commit history was lost due to this. I have learned from my mistakes, and while this was painful, I believe it has made me a more careful and patient developer.
