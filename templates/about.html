        <p class="about about-intro">While working in a research lab at ASU, I developed an interest in using computers to
            conduct data analysis and data visualization. I began by using Excel followed by learning the basics of R for more complex math and statistics.
            As I was deep into my research, the pandemic hit. I sought new ways to fill my free time, and my interest in R led
            to an online course in Python. What was then a casual hobby, coding to-do lists and simple games playable in a computer's 
            terminal, grew into much more than that. Once I began learning the basics of data structures and algorithms, I was hooked.
            With an initial plan of pursuing an M.S. in Bioinformatics, I chose to pursue a second bachelor's in Computer Science
            due to my desire to write more complex algorithms and my fascination with different programming languages. I hope to use 
            my diverse skills to contribute to meaningful genetic, ecological, or agricultural research.
