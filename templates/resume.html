            <i class="job-text">October 2019 - May 2020</i>
            <p class="job-text">Before the pandemic cut my research short, I worked in a Plant Ecophysiology Lab directed by Dr. Neufeld. I studied the effects of high light stress on ornamental plants, using croton as a study sample. My research aimed to determine how pigmentation changed with varying light intensity, which relied on the use of a <a class="project-link" href="https://www.licor.com/env/products/photosynthesis/LI-6800/" target="_blank"><u>LI-6800</u></a> and sampling.</p>
            <p class="job-text">The use of a LI-6800 allowed me to test varying light situations and could see in real time how the plant was reacting. In addition to these lab trials, I conducted greenhouse trials by placing some plants in a shade chamber and comparing them to those in full sun.</p>
            <p class="job-text">Using Excel, with the plan to use R later on, I was able to create visualizations of CO2 output versus light intensity to gain an understanding of how the plant responded to stress.</p>
            <p class="job-text">While I was working on a presentation to showcase this work at The Association of Southeastern Biologists, the pandemic of 2020 brought my reserach to a sudden halt.</p>
